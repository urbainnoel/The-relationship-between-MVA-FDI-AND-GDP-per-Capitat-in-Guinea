## Abstract

In its pursuit of sustainable development and global prominence, Guinea has embarked on a comprehensive industrialization journey outlined in the National Industrial Development Policy (PNDIG). This study investigates the relationship between MVA, FDI inflows, and GDP per capita in Guinea, with a focus on the transformative effects of the PNDIG. Through rigorous empirical analysis from 1988 to 2022, this research employs ARDL modeling techniques to examine Guinea's industrialization strategy. The study analyzes the long-term impacts and short-term dynamics of MVA and FDI inflows on Guinea's economic performance. The findings reveal insights into Guinea's industrial landscape. The study confirms the long-term relationship between MVA and GDP per capita, while highlighting the need to enhance the manufacturing sector's productivity and technological sophistication. Additionally, the study emphasizes the positive correlation between FDI inflows and GDP per capita, illustrating the role of foreign investment in driving Guinea's economic growth. In addition to these relationships, the study emphasizes the influence of lagged MVAs on GDP per capita, showing the need for initiative-taking policy interventions to strengthen industrial resilience and economic performance. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of Guinea's industrialization narrative, offering empirical insights that align with the nation's aspirations for sustainable and inclusive economic development. By providing actionable policy pathways and addressing critical research gaps, this research endeavor supports Guinea's journey towards harnessing its industrial potential and achieving enduring prosperity.
